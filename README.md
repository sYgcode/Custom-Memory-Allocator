# Custom Memory Allocator

To try and understand more about low level memory allocation and the heap I challenged
myself to create my own implementation of the dynamic memory and the commands malloc and 
free. my implementation is currently in C++ and implemented in Object Oriented Programming 
style.

The project gave me hands down knowledge on how to safely manage memory, request memory from
the kernel using system calls, use it and then return it. 

I would love input on changes, constructive critism, or new ideas on how to implement my project
more effeciently.

PS: attached is the original porject proposal I wrote for myslef, I'd love to see other people
implement it in their own ways, tag me if you do! (:
